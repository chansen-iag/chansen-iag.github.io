# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
<br>
I have had the pleasure to learn and grow in both Technical Support and Professional Services/Consulting environments when it comes to troubleshooting and administering Identity Manager. My time has been mostly spent in learning and administering Micro Focus IDM, but by the very nature of Identity Manager, it's allowed me to learn a wide variety products, protocols, languages, and environments. I learned how to connect downstream and work with the following: Microsoft AD/Entra, REST/SCIM, Linux, Mainframe, Databases, Delimited Text/CSV import and exports, Privileged Access Manager, SOAP, LDAP, OAUTH, and Google, just to name a few. IDM has allowed me to gain a wide variety of knowledge in all kinds of environments. In professional services, I was required to work with Agile and Waterfall based development and administration to provide these solutions to many different companies to simplify their IDM and access requirements. Many of these solutions also required Roles and Resource design to identify users that required certain rights, which in turn would provide them access to their required environments. Regular governance and maintenance of these roles and identities was often required as well, to avoid orphaned or stale accounts that could risk compromising unauthorized access into the connected systems.
