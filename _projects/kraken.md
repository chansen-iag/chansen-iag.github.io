# "A terrifying Kraken reduced to a simple squid"

I was brought in to work with another customer who was not feeling the love with the suite of NetIQ Cybersecurity products in their environment. The Engineer that I was working with was also newly brought over to try and fix the growing agitation that their users were facing. I personally have always been fond of all the products, but they can certainly be fickle without proper design. The customer was starting the effort to consider other products - which we were still happy to assist with as required - but in the meantime they wanted to tidy things up as best as possible.

Most of the efforts were focused on upgrading the environment to supported versions, rebuilding a few drivers, and other policy updates to help the IDM environment work better with all their connected applications. After many changes and about 2 years of effort, things were much improved, the Engineer was feeling far better about the functionality and features of IDM, and their considerations moving to other products were put on hold since things were much more functional than they were previously. I am not here to toot my own horn here - the Engineer himself put forth a great deal of effort as well to make this happen. Our efforts combined made his superiors happy, which in turn made him happy, and ended with me happy. To loosly quote this Engineer: "This product has been a Kraken to the team for years, something terrifying and wreaking havok with no recourse to resolve it. Now it's a harmless squid, and can safely be left to it's own devices."
